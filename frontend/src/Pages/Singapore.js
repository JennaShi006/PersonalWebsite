                <h3>Singapore culture</h3>
                <p>Singapore is a culture that highly values organization. From the MRT to the hawker centers, Singapore is so thoughtful in their design. It is at its peak in its user friendliness, making the country easy to navigate for both foreigners and residents. </p>

                <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
                <p>One of the things I found challenging was adapting to the communication style. While I prefer more direct communication, different team leads will tend to have different communication styles. 
                    <br />At the beginning of the internship, although guidelines of the project were laid out, it was confusing to decipher what was the central functionality requested and the urgency of different tasks that correlated to the project. When we would suggest solutions, and it seemed like everything suggested is potentially beneficial, but not one solution would be decided on clearly, which made it difficult to proceed. In order to adapt to this circumstance, I ended up taking a greater initiative in asking questions to gain a better understanding of the big picture, and to be able to suggest what I believed to be the best solution.</p>
            
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>One of the lessons I’ve learned from my time abroad is to not be afraid to ask questions. If you’re curious about something, don’t employ the mindset that you’ll just ask it next time – there may not be a next time. Go ask the question about their culture that you’re afraid might offend people (most of the time it’s not). Go ask the question about the project, I promise you’re doing both the team and yourself a favor down the road. Time flies by and you may never see yourself in the same place ever again, so don’t be afraid to ask those questions!</p>
                <p>Another lesson I’ve learned is the importance of taking care of our environment. In Singapore, there is a heavy emphasis on maintaining the planet we call home, and I believe that there are things that we can learn from them – being more conscious about AC usage, plastic water bottles, and improving public transportation. </p>

                <h3>Using my intercultural experience</h3>
                <p>This intercultural experience has opened my eyes to how fast Asia is also progressing within the field of technology. I believe that with this new view, I will more consciously follow the advancements made by Eastern countries as I continue my studies at UF and in my career. I also see myself considering working abroad in the future.</p>
